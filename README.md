Stock price prediction is one among the complex machine learning problems. It depends on a large number of factors which contribute to changes in the supply and demand. This paper presents the technical analysis of the various strategies proposed in the past, for predicting the price of a stock, and evaluation of a novel approach for the same.

Stock prices are represented as time series data and neural networks are trained to learn the patterns from trends.
